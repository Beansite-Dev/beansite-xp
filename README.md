# Beansite XP
This is the official repository for the up-and-coming predecessor to [Beansite 95](https://mb95.vercel.app). Naturally, both being themed after Windows OS versions, It came to name this "Beansite XP"

## Why Start Anew?
There were many flaws with the original beansite. For example, the original codebase had been entirely bee written in plain html on a chromebook when I was grounded to pass time during school and at home (This is evident in b95 1.x patches). I did port the codebase to react, but took shortcuts in order to avoid reqriting the entire codebase. I was also new to react, so was not as skillful as I now am. I decided upon using an in-browser babel tranformer, which would later become a hindrance in patches as early as 2.2. It was a challenge to try to work with the in-browser babel transformer, as I was more experienced with vite, even at the time. Modules and others were near imposible, further limiting the progress made. I had made several attempts to fix this (which can be seen in Beansite 98, the unreleased, original predecessor to Beansite95. I had attempted to rewrite the code using vite/react, but gave up after almost a week of constant bugs) but was not successful and had decided upon using the babel transformer for that reason. 

## Why Now?
After creating, mantaining, and constantly updating beansite 95, I had simply gotten tired of the limitation. Now that had been coding for more than 3 years (1.5years in javascript), I had felt ready to put the final nail in the coffin for beansite 95 and continue with brand new product. I was also leaving the middleschool and entering the highscool. Many og my classmates used beansite 95 and I wanted to expand to the grades above me for them to enjoy as well. I decided to retry, but with the new theme of Windows XP in place. It was a struggle at first, but I had solzed every single bug I had with 98 and 95. When development really took off, I decided to upload everything to github.

## What's Different?
There are many things different with beansite 95 and beansite xp. The most notable being the window creation system. Previously, the proccess for creating a window. you had to manually create taskbar icons and shortcuts. Now, all you need to do is create a window and the new-and-improved SDK will handle the rest. Also, the wndows used to have no form of storage besides their elements themselves. Now, windows can be stored using javascript objects to hold metadata. These objects are added to a large object that can be updated by the SDK.
